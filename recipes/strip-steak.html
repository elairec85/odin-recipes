        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - salt, black pepper, garlic powder</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Seasoning</strong> - marinades, thyme, rosemary or other herbs and spices</li>

        <h4>How To Cook a New York Strip Steak - Step-by-step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow the steaks to rest at room temperature for 30-60 minutes if you have time—preheat the oven to 400° convection or 425° conventional oven.</li>
            <li>Trim any easily trimmable edge fat. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Season to your taste. A good sprinkle of black pepper and Kosher salt is all you need, but I use 7:2:2 (my homemade seasoning).</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter or use oil in an oven-safe pan (cast-iron preferred) over medium-high heat. Some prefer oil due to butter's lower smoke point, but I have never had a problem with either.</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, add the strip steaks.</li>
            <li>Sear both sides of the steaks for about 2 minutes each. Sear close to the final color you want.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to the preheated oven. Now comes the variables: the steak thickness, how long you seared it, and the oven's actual temperature. Cook to the final temperature minus a few degrees—the steaks will rise a few degrees during the rest after cooking.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 5 to 7 minutes to reach 130-135° (medium-rare) or 7 to 9 minutes for 140°-145° (medium). Remove from the oven, tent with foil, and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving. COOK TO THE TEMPERATURE, NOT BY TIME ALONE.</li>
        </ol>
