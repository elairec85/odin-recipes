        <h2>Pan Seared Oven Baked Chicken Breast</h2>
        <p>This is how we cooked for many years. We had a freezer in the garage fridge for meat only. I would take out a couple of chicken breasts, a pork tenderloin, and some steaks, let them thaw in the refrigerator for a few days and work our way through them.</p>
        <p>I would get home late from work. But we want a nice dinner on a short timeline. I spend 5-10 minutes of preparation time and usually finish in the oven as I'm unwinding, and in 15-20 minutes, dinner was ready.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li><strong>Chicken Breast - Fresh preferred</li>

            <li><strong>Optional Seasoning</strong> - marinades, thyme, rosemary or other herbs and spices</strong></li>

        <h4>How To Cook A Pan Seared Oven Baked Chicken - Step-by-step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375° convection or 400° conventional.</li>
            <li>Trim and pat dry the chicken. If the chicken breast is over ¾ inches thick, flatten it with a meat mallet or the bottom of a heavy pan.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe pan (cast iron preferred) over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper or the seasoning of your choice.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully lay the chicken breasts in the hot pan. Brown both sides for 3-4 minutes each—to almost the color you want when eating.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes until an internal temperature of 165°. The thinner breast will be for 15 minutes, and the bigger ones for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
